# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. form validation is used in this project
2. Solved problem:i have added two item in cart page. When i increase the quantity of second item it works well. But when increase first item amount, the second item comes the first position and first item go second position.
3. Solved problem: set and get item in localStorage permanently. so, when refresh cart data still present.
4. Solved problem: when show card details page and if refresh the card details page, the item still present.
